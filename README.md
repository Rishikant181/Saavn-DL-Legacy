# saavndl
A command-line downloader for downloading songs from JioSaavn

This downloader works by mimicking the HTTP requests used by the JioSaavn Web-App in order to stream songs.
Install the packages in requirements.txt before using(I would recommend using a virtualenv for now).

Type: python saavndl.py --help for usage.

*NOTE* This tool is still in early stages. Now it works as a basic downloader. Improvements are bound to happen.
